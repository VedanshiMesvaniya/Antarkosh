# Runtime image for Antarkosh — FastAPI API + the bundled React UI in one
# process. Runs from source (WORKDIR /app) so PROJECT_ROOT resolves to the repo
# root and the committed frontend/ + config/ are found. An editable install
# links src/ in place and installs the dependencies from pyproject.toml.

# System libraries:
#  - libmagic1 is REQUIRED by python-magic (Stage 1 file detection); without it
#    the app fails to import.
#  - ghostscript / libgl1 / libglib2.0-0 back camelot + opencv (table-extraction
#    dependency) so the pip install never trips on a missing shared library.
# OCR (OCR.space) and the vector store (Qdrant Cloud) are network APIs — there
# are no local services to install.
