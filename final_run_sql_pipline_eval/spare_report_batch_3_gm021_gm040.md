## 4. 🔬 Key Architectural Highlights

1. **Complex SQL Reasoning (13 / 13 Perfect Score):**
   - Handled non-trivial relational challenges seamlessly: multi-table conversion funnels (`gm-032`), anti-joins between quotations and orders (`gm-033`, `gm-035`), temporal shipping duration diffs (`gm-037`, `gm-038`), and machine production aggregations (`gm-040`).
2. **Zero Hallucinated Columns:**
   - Column registry and safety filters ensured 100% schema column compliance across all joins.
3. **Pacing Success:**
   - With 5.0s delay, all 16 queries completed without triggering any provider rate limits.
